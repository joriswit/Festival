Festival is a Sokoban solver based on the FESS search algorithm (published
in CoG 2020). Festival is the first reported program that solves all 90 levels 
of the XSokoban benchmark. It also scores nicely on other level sets.

The official Festival website is located here:

The Windows version of Festival can use multiple cores, but this Android version
of Festival uses only one core.

Festival for Android can integrate with any Sokoban clone that supports solver
plug-ins, like Soko++.
